#the training set has the sale price of each property but the test set d/n (since
#that is what we're trying to predict).

#first add SalePrice variable to test set.
#NOTE: this will create new data set with the new column as opposed to adding new
#column to data set that already exists

#you need to convert the sale price into a numeric before combining data

#before combining data sets you need to clean up both the test2 and training data sets
#       1. test2 has 3 columns not in training: X1stFlrSF, X2ndFlrSF, X3SsnPorch
#       2. in training those 3 parameters are known as: 1stFlrSF, 2ndFlrSF, 3SsnPorch
